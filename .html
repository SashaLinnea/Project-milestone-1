 fun facts about me!

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p2> My family is from South America, my mom and dad were both born in
Guyana. Guyana is considered to be a part of the caribbean. I was
born here in the United States (Georgia), but I still have the 
privelege of experiencing some of the culture (music, food, etc) 
from my family's home country. One funny experience that I had 
when I lived in Guyana for nine months as a kid, I would like to 
share. There was one night when I was sleeping, I randomly woke to
find some sort of water bug/ roach crawling on the bed and vividly 
remember it biting me on the knee. The next morning I felt actual 
pain in my knee, but when I told my family the story they told me 
those bugs don't bite and that I was dreaming. Its something I'll
always be confused about.
</br> </br>
    To go a bit more into my background, I moved around a decent amount
when I was younger, so I experienced a few different elementary schools.
I defintely think it made it difficult for me to make friends when I 
would be put in new environments that I had to get used to. I was raised
by a single mother, and often lived in a large household with my grandma
and a lot of my other family members. This is something I enjoyed because
there was always someone to talk to and something to do, even if that was 
nothing, we did nothing together. I never had a close relationship with my
dad, and its something that we're still working on till this day. I think
the abscense of my father made me appreciate how close my moms side of the 
family is and hopefully always will be.
</br> </br>
    Seeing how hard my mom has worked and still does is a major motivator for
me to continue pursuing higher education. Although I've never been passionate
about work or a career, my desire to take care of my mom and be able to 
experience financial freedom is the source of my ambition. In terms of school,
I have never been someone that learning comes easy too, but I've always maintained
good grades by applying myself. The major obstacles I've struggled with have always 
been procrastination and a lack of discipline. I often wait for the motivation to 
come before I can do what needs to be done, but the motivation often isn't there.
I am constantly working towards being a better version of myself and having that 
discipline because I know the consistency that comes with that will pay off in the 
long run.
